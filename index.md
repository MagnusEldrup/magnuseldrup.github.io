I work on public and development economics, with a focus on taxation,
enforcement, and the interaction between formal and informal sectors.

Exemptions are a defining feature of income tax systems in developing countries, yet standard optimal tax models consistently fail to explain them. These models assume full compliance and therefore miss the horizontal inequality created between formal workers who pay taxes and informal workers who do not. To remedy this, I expand the optimal tax framework to capture untaxable workers, allowing social preferences to reflect concerns about both vertical and horizontal inequality. Survey evidence from Kenya, where informality is widespread, shows that respondents place much higher social weight on formal taxpayers relative to otherwise identical informal workers, indicating strong horizontal inequality aversion. Combining these empirical preferences with administrative tax data yields model prescriptions of lower rates and high exemption thresholds, more consistent with observed policy. Alternative explanations such as extensive margin responses or administrative costs cannot account for exemptions of this magnitude. The results suggest that in high-informality settings, large exemptions can be welfare-improving, disciplining the conventional policy recommendation of broadening the tax base.
